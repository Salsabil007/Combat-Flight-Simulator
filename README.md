# Combat-Flight-Simulator
It is a simple game built in JavaFX. A combat game where I have my own plane that I can control and enemies are free to attack 
me. I can fire them and destroy. I have used the concept of Thread and networking in this project. This is a pretty simple 
and my very fast game in JavaFX.
